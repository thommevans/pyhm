pyhm
====

This is the development version of the pyhm software package. 

pyhm is a Python package for defining hierarchical Bayesian models, with routines to optimise and sample from the posterior distribution. Currently, pyhm only supports the scipy optimisation routines and standard Metropolis-Hastings sampling; however, pyhm was built with extensibility in mind, and adding further capabilities will be trivial due to the modular structure of the software. In particular, implementing a nested sampling option is a high priority. This software drew a lot of inspiration from the pymc package.
